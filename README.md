### Notes

Estimated Time : 5hrs | Actual Time: 10hrs

- Played with using "mini-components" within my components, made it easy to deal with list items (aka the product images), which is something I had a hard time dealing with before. helped out by : https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/managing-state

- way longer than I thought it'd take, but took time to make sure it was broken down in a way I like, so worth it!
